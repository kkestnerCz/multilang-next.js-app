    "someParagraph": "Procrastination is a pronounced and chronic tendency to postpone the fulfillment of (mostly administrative or psychologically demanding) duties and tasks (especially unpleasant ones) until a later time. It can represent a risk phenomenon for mental health. Psychologists often describe such behavior as a mechanism to help the individual cope with the anxiety associated with the performance of the given activity. According to some researchers, the criteria that define procrastination are as follows: it is counterproductive, unnecessary and delaying. Procrastination is associated with so-called decision paralysis, i.e. that a person is not able to make a decision and choose from several options. A more complex choice leads to postponing the decision. Procrastination can result in stress, guilt, psychological crisis and loss of productivity. The combination of these feelings can lead to further procrastination, creating a cycle. Procrastination is to some extent a normal psychological behavior. However, chronic procrastination can be a symptom of a serious mental disorder. People so affected are often afraid to seek help because of social stigma and the widespread misconception that procrastination is caused by laziness, low willpower or low ambition.",
